# Apna College DSA Sheet – Java Solutions 🚀

This repository documents my **Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) learning journey in Java**,
following the **Apna College DSA Sheet**.

For **every topic**, I maintain **two separate folders**:
- One for **personal practice while learning the topic**
- One for **DSA Sheet questions related to that topic**

This separation helps in keeping **concept learning** and **problem-solving** well organized and easy to revise.
